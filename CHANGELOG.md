- Time Series: Added PSU level configuration and response shape

### Changed
- Bumped API version to 1.6.0 in spec.json and UI header
- Normalized temperature unit to "Â°C" in MetricUnit enum for consistency

### Compatibility
- OpenAPI remains 3.0.3; Swagger UI remains v5.10.5
- All existing UI styling, dark theme, and Try It Out functionality preserved
- No breaking changes for existing endpoints; new fields/levels are additive
